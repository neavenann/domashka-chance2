Belief in the breeze
The smoky morning haze
The sun on her face
and the touch of lovers' hands
The pain that comes today
Is here, then goes away
And we are homeward bound
And I
I want this more than life
I want this more than life
I want this more than life
To touch something real
Will help your wounds heal
Like the sun on your face
The dreams of starry nights
And we are homeward bound
And I
I want this more than life
I want this more than life
I want this more than life
I want this more than life
